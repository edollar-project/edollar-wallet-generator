# edollar-wallet-generator
Edollar offline wallet generator (forked from https://github.com/moneromooo-monero/monero-wallet-generator) 

This page generates a new Edollar address. It is self contained and does all the necessary calculations locally, so is suitable for generating a new wallet on a machine that is not connected to the network, and may even never be. This way, you can create a Edollar wallet without risking the keys.
